## HAWASSI (Hamiltonian Wave-Ship & Structure Interaction) simulates phase resolved waves for coastal and ocean environments.

HAWASSI is a software package for the simulation of realistic waves in wave tanks (1HD), i.e. long-crested waves, and short-crested waves (2HD) with a directional spectrum to simulate waves in oceanic and
coastal areas, and in complicated areas with break waters and in harbours with (partial) reflections from walls with prescribed reflection properties. Copyright Â© 2015 LabMath-Indonesia
